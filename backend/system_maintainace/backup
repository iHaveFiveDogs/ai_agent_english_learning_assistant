⚠️ Optional Improvements
Precache persona vectorstores
If your dataset grows, dynamically rebuilding Chroma per request may slow things down.
You can cache each persona’s FAISS or Chroma vectorstore at startup or in Redis.

Fallback if no docs are found
Currently it logs and returns "No relevant docs" — you can route to a fallback node or return "I don't have enough info to answer".

Stream LLM response (in chat_with_user)
Helps UX when frontend is waiting. You can use .astream() for token-level delivery.
