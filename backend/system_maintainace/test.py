#     When Deepankar Rustagi last raised money for OmniRetail in 2022, excitement was high for African startups addressing the supply chain and operational challenges in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector. At one point, these startups received more capital than all sectors, except fintech.

# Recently, though, the industry‚Äôs enthusiasm and venture capital‚Äôs interest have faded, as various business models have struggled under mounting pressure.

# Yet for Rustagi, OmniRetail isn‚Äôt just another B2B commerce platform; it‚Äôs an ambitious effort to reshape informal retail across Nigeria and West Africa using technology and embedded finance in a scalable, profitable way. Now, that vision has received further endorsement with a $20 million Series A equity funding round. This capital will help OmniRetail expand its presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast, while deepening its focus on embedded finance products.

# The round was co-led by Norwegian development finance institution Norfund and Lagos-based VC firm Timon Capital, with follow-on participation from Ventures Platform, Aruwa Capital, Goodwell Investments (via Alitheia Capital), and Flour Mills of Nigeria.

# This marks Norfund‚Äôs first direct equity investment in an African startup, and according to Rustagi, puts OmniRetail on a path to dominating in a segment where others have struggled to grow profitably. OmniRetail has raised $38 million in equity and debt since its inception in 2019. 

# OmniRetail‚Äôs model digitizes order management for 145 manufacturers, more than 5,800 distributors and services over 150,000 informal retailers across 12 cities in Nigeria, Ghana and Ivory Coast.

# Retailers use the app to order inventory, access working capital, and make digital payments. In the background is a third-party logistics network of over 1,100 vehicles and distributed warehousing capacity managed by 85 local logistics partners.

# Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX is getting its own official company town.

# Residents of an area around SpaceX‚Äôs Starbase launch site in southern Texas voted overwhelmingly on Saturday to incorporate as a city ‚Äî also named Starbase. According to results posted online by the Cameron County Elections Department, there were 212 votes in favor and only six against.

# In a post on his social media site X, Musk wrote that Starbase, Texas ‚ÄúIs now a real city!‚Äù 

# The new city‚Äôs residents are believed to mostly be SpaceX employees. On Saturday, they also voted to elect three current and former SpaceX employees ‚Äî Bobby Peden, Jordan Buss, and Jenna Petrzelka ‚Äî who ran unopposed to serve, respectively, as Starbase‚Äôs mayor and two commissioners.

# The Associated Press reports that SpaceX hasn‚Äôt shared many specifics about why it wanted to incorporate the area. The company said it already manages the roads, utilities, and ‚Äúthe provisions of schooling and medical care,‚Äù and it‚Äôs also looking to shift authority from the county to the new city government to close the nearby Boca Chica beach and state park for launches.

# Musk ‚Äî who recently said he would be reducing his role with the Trump administration‚Äôs controversial Department of Government Efficiency to a ‚Äúday or two‚Äù per week ‚Äî announced last year that he was moving SpaceX‚Äôs headquarters from El Segundo, California to the Starbase facility in Texas. 

# At the time, Musk said he‚Äôd ‚Äúhad enough of dodging gangs of violent drug addicts just to get in and out of the building‚Äù and that the ‚Äúfinal straw‚Äù was a California bill that prohibits schools from disclosing students‚Äô sexuality or gender identity without consent.
