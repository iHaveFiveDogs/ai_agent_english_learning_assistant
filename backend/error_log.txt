Error: Weird Unicode characters found in JSON response for chunk '"Despite a clearly superior offer being practically thrown at him, the Trustee determined to seek Court approval of a transaction" with Aquila, the filing reads. A lawyer for Aquila did not respond to a request for comment. As many as eight parties signed NDAs and evaluated Canoo's assets prior to the sale, a lawyer for the bankrupt startup revealed earlier this month. He said only a few of those came close to making a bid, including one group that the bankruptcy trustee said could raise concerns with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States because of its (unspecified) "foreign ownership." It's not clear if Garson's bid is what the trustee was referring to.'
