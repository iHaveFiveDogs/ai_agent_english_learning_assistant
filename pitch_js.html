        <p>Reimagining product innovation through contextual intelligence.</p>

        <h2>Our Insight</h2>
        <p>
          Modern internet products are built on understanding the user's interests.<br>
          AI makes this understanding contextual and dynamic.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Context Is the New Input</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We upload articles, data, or prompts</li>
          <li>AI responds based on deep context understanding</li>
          <li>Even tool/function invocation is context-driven</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Context = Reaction = Product</h2>
        <p>
          Pretrained AI can react to regular, structured contexts (e.g., etymology, grammar).<br>
          For unknowns, it adapts in-place, predicting what matters most in the moment.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>The AI-Powered Future</h2>
        <p>
          With this model:<br>
          - Great products are reaction engines<br>
          - Great companies are context stewards
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Ready to Build the Future?</h2>
        <p>
          Let's turn ideas into living, responsive systems.<br>
          AI isn't a tool â€” it's the engine.
